#### MENTORS: Asst. Prof. Zlatko Stapić, PhD (FOI) and Hroje Galić (Arbona)

The mRent application is a mobile version of the AIforRenters application that serves to support renters in the process of booking accommodation units. The purpose of this application is to allow an overview of all incoming requests processed by the AIforRenters module. Namely, the AIforRenters module was developed earlier as part of the Software Engineering course, and performs the aforementioned function - it receives input data from two key incoming channels - e-mail and web form. The module itself processes the incoming data, then checks the availability of the requested accommodation unit in the database for the requested number of persons and based on one of the three possible states of the accommodation unit, takes an e-mail template showing it inside of the Request component on the home screen of the application.
